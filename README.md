# Project Shooter

## Description

This is a simple shooter game created using Python and Pygame. The game involves controlling a player character to shoot enemies that spawn on the screen. The goal is to score points by shooting enemies while avoiding them as they move downward. 

This project serves as a learning experience for working with Python and Pygame, as well as game development concepts. 

In the future, I plan to develop a version of this game using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

## Features
